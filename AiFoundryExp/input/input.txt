General context
We are building a software-as-a-service (SaaS) aimed at Romanian micro-companies and SMEs that automates the entire “invoice-to-pay” cycle. The goal is to slash the time and errors associated with processing invoices while giving full visibility over cash-flow—without forcing the client to change their bank or accounting system.

Main objective
Aggregate every invoice and payment in a single dashboard.

Trigger automatic (or semi-automatic, with approval) decisions on what, when and how much to pay, based on budget and risk rules defined by the client.

Provide end-to-end traceability of every action for audit and compliance.

Business benefits for the client
Controlled cash-flow – clients can set monthly, quarterly or annual caps per spending category and supplier; breaches raise alerts or request special approvals.

Lower operating costs – eliminates manual data entry (invoices, payments, matching); for a small firm that’s 5-10 hours/month, for a mid-size firm > 40 hours/month.

Avoided errors & penalties – automatic invoice-payment matching cuts duplicate, wrong or late payments that trigger fines.

Scales without extra hires – a company can grow invoice volume 10× without adding back-office staff.

Compliance & audit-ready – every step leaves a footprint (who, what, when, why) useful for tax inspections or external audits.

Fast implementation – no ERP migration needed; the product works with any data source via adaptors.

Core features (business-friendly explanation)
Invoice collection

The system pulls invoices from multiple sources; in the MVP we use an internal adaptor that generates test data for demo & QA. Real adaptors (e.g., SmartBill, other ERPs) can be plugged in anytime.

Smart supplier catalog

Automatic white-/black-listing; trust score calculated from on-time payment history and legal checks (e.g., state debts).

Limit rules

The client sets caps per transaction and per period (month, quarter, semester, year). Breaches can be blocked, marked “pending approval,” or approved by a special role (“Bypass Officer”).

Virtual accounts & budgets

A real bank account can be “split” virtually into compartments (“Equipment,” “Taxes,” “Fleet” etc.) with its own budget. The system knows where to draw funds and how much is left.

Open-banking payment initiation

The user never logs into the bank platform; they hit “Pay” and sign electronically.

Automatic invoice ↔ payment matching

After the account is debited, the transaction lines up with the invoice and is marked “Reconciled,” shortening month-end closing time.

Configurable approval flow

For large amounts or new suppliers, an extra approval step is required; the logic is client-defined.

Events & audit trail

Every change (invoice creation, budget tweak, approval, rejection, resubmission) becomes a permanently stored event, visible in a filterable timeline.

Who uses it
Finance administrator – sets rules, budgets and sees macro reports.

Accountant – imports/exports data, validates exceptions.

Procurement manager – approves new suppliers and limit overrides.

Auditor – reviews the event logs.

Success metrics (KPIs)
Average invoice-processing time drops below 2 minutes (vs. 10-15 manually).

95 % automatic invoice-payment matches within the first 3 months.

≥ 30 % savings in financial operations costs after 6 months.

Zero late-payment penalties reported by clients after the first quarter of use.

Constraints & assumptions
Data protection via full client isolation (separate database per tenant).

Bank connectivity only through licensed PSD2 providers, reducing our compliance burden.

The MVP initially runs on test data; going live on real data depends on activating ERP connectors and signing contracts with open-banking providers.

# Romanian Invoice-to-Pay Automation Solution: Discovery Q&A

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates key questions and responses regarding the development of an invoice-to-pay automation solution for Romanian micro-companies and SMEs. The solution aims to address the gap in affordable invoice processing tools outside of expensive ERP systems, enabling businesses to focus on growth rather than manual payment management.

## Problem Definition

### Current Market Gap
When asked about common complaints from Romanian micro-companies and SMEs regarding invoice-to-pay processes, the primary issue identified is that such solutions don't exist outside of expensive ERPs. While compliance and cash flow management aren't the primary concerns, the focus is on improving quality of life for business owners, allowing them to concentrate on scaling their businesses rather than manually tracking and remembering invoice payments.

### Manual Process Prevalence
Manual processes, including spreadsheets and manual bank transfers, remain widely used among Romanian micro-companies. This confirms the significant opportunity for automation in this market segment. However, while these manual processes create inefficiencies, the solution's scope deliberately excludes broader financial optimization features such as budget optimization or cash flow prediction tools.

## Target User Profile

### Industry Coverage
The solution is designed to be industry-agnostic, providing flexibility to serve various sectors within the Romanian micro-company and SME market. This broad approach maximizes the potential user base while maintaining product focus.

### Technical Prerequisites
Target businesses must have at least basic invoicing software, as RO eFactura now mandates electronic invoice reporting in Romania. This requirement establishes a minimum level of digital maturity among potential users. While businesses face challenges with eFactura compliance itself, addressing these compliance issues falls outside the scope of this application.

### Secondary User Considerations
While accountants and outsourced financial services represent a potentially valuable secondary user group, they are not included in the MVP scope. This decision allows for focused product development while leaving room for future expansion.

## Key Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
The solution will track several core metrics beyond the initially stated processing time reduction, cost savings, and penalties avoided. Additional priority metrics include the number of users onboarded monthly, with success measured on a quarterly basis.

### Customer Engagement Metrics
Two critical metrics for measuring customer success have been identified:
- Customer acquisition rate, measuring new users added per month and quarter
- Customer activation rate, tracking users who actively engage with the platform after initial sign-up

These metrics provide insight into both market traction and product-market fit.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competition
Currently, there are no direct competitors offering similar invoice automation solutions in the Romanian market. This represents a significant first-mover advantage opportunity.

### Indirect Competition
While banks and ERP providers could potentially offer custom solutions as indirect competition, this threat is not anticipated in the near term. Romanian banks and financial platforms are not expected to launch open-banking invoice management tools soon, providing a window of opportunity for market establishment.

## Monetization Strategy

### Subscription Model
The platform will employ a subscription-based SaaS model with multiple tiers differentiated by combinations of features, invoice volume limits, and user counts. Pricing will be primarily based on invoice volume rather than business size, making the model scalable and predictable for users.

### Tier Structure
The proposed tier structure includes:
- Free tier: Basic invoice aggregation, single payment initiation, and virtual accounts
- Paid tiers: Advanced features including configurable approval flows, enhanced reporting tools, and higher volume limits

Virtual accounts, initially considered a premium feature, will be included in the free tier to enhance the value proposition and encourage adoption.

### Additional Revenue Considerations
While advanced reporting and premium ERP integrations are planned for future development, onboarding support and training will remain free to reduce adoption barriers. This approach prioritizes user acquisition over immediate revenue maximization.

## Distribution and Market Entry Strategy

### Initial Go-to-Market Approach
The market entry strategy focuses on running pilots with select micro-companies and establishing partnerships. This controlled approach allows for product refinement based on real user feedback while building credibility through early success stories.

### Partnership Strategy
While specific partnerships with open-banking providers, ERP connectors, or accounting firms have not been fully developed, market-entry partners such as financial technology groups, accounting software providers, or business hubs could help establish credibility and accelerate adoption. However, industry-specific associations and trade unions are not considered viable channels for expansion, with the focus remaining on organic growth and strategic partnerships.

## Conclusion

This invoice-to-pay automation solution addresses a clear market gap in Romania, where micro-companies and SMEs currently rely on expensive ERPs or manual processes for invoice management. With no direct competition, mandatory electronic invoicing creating a digitally-ready user base, and a freemium model designed to drive adoption, the solution is well-positioned for market entry. Success will be measured through quarterly assessments of user acquisition and activation rates, with initial market validation through targeted pilots and strategic partnerships.
